        <p>
            Hi! I'm Linda. If you work with me for any amount of time, you'll learn three things about me:
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                I'm resilient. The process of learning, applying, and improving is a regular cycle in my work. Frustration
                can hold me back for a time, but I always keep at it until I accomplish what I'm trying to do.
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm perseptive. It's relatively easy for me to pick up on where others are coming from, be it figuring out
                what a customer's trying to explain, or knowing when my co-workers need to vent so everyone can move
                forward. While I don't enjoy them (and prefer to avoid them), navigating tense situations and striving to
                understand where people are coming from comes naturally to me.
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm analytical. I love organizing and digging into details. I'll catch proof reading mistakes that others
                miss. Tracking jobs, maintaining spreadsheets, and puzzling out discrepancies and bugs is where I really
                shine. Pulling together information from multiple sources and compiling them all into one resource brings
                such a sense of accomplishment and joy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            One of my favorite parts of my job is getting to bring ideas to life. No matter the scale, being able to see
            something take shape and go out into the world is such a joy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-goals about-text">
          <h3 class="about-headers green">My Goals</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>I'm searching for my first developer job!</strong>
            <br><br>
            I really enjoy working with JavaScript, wrangling data, and playing with design. I'd really love to work on
            location (<i>looking to relocate!</i>), where I can be truly immersed in programming and be able to learn
            and
            grow with my teammates - though I'd happily work remote as well. My ideal company would be a place where everyone is free to ask questions and work together openly. I could use mentorship and a safe place to learn, where I can work on something that benefits other people.
            <br><br>
            I'm not looking to be <i>the</i> best - just continuously better than I am in this moment.
          </p>
        </div>
      <div class="about-goals about-text">

            <a href="https://es6.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ES6 for Everyone</a> - Finally working through
            this course fully. I use some ES6 features all the time (hello template strings!), but some things - like
            destructuring, spread, and rest - I still don't fully understand. So diving into all of this will be a
            great
            help.
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical writing! I want to blog more for myself and others - I know there are aspects of programming and
            the path of learning that can be helpful to read from multiple perspectives, and I love to write. So
            whether
            it's writing about my understanding of a term or algorithm, struggles while walking this path, or
            successes
            and helpful hints for my future self, I want to share these moments with whoever wants to read them (even
            if
            no one does!).
