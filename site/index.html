        <p>
          Hi! I'm Linda. Here's what you should know about me:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              I'm resilient. The process of learning, applying, and improving is a common theme in my life. Frustration
              can hold me back for a time, but I've learned when I need to take a break, and when to keep pushing
              forward. I'm able to recognize when I might need to change tactics, and can navigate around
              difficulties to get what I want.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm perceptive. It's relatively easy for me to pick up on where others are coming from, be it figuring out
              what a customer's trying to explain, or knowing when my co-workers need to vent so everyone can move
              forward. While I don't enjoy tense situations, navigating them and striving to
              meet people where they are and understand them comes naturally to me.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm analytical. I love organizing and digging into details. I'll catch proofreading mistakes that others
              miss. Tracking jobs, maintaining spreadsheets, and puzzling out discrepancies and bugs is my JAM. Pulling
              together information from multiple sources and compiling it all into one resource brings
              such a sense of relief and fulfillment.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm creative. One of my favorite parts of my career is getting to bring ideas to life. No matter the
              scale, being able to see something take shape and go out into the world is such a joy.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-goals about-text">
        <h3 class="about-headers green">My Goals</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>I'm searching for my first developer job!</strong>
          <br><br>
          My favorite language is JavaScript - it's my first coding love, really. I'm fairly proficient with HTML and
          CSS too. I'm typically drawn to projects where I'm making data easier to view or track, though I can be
          distracted playing with the design quite often. I prefer VS Code as my editor of choice, & can navigate Git (most of the time).
          <br><br>
          I'd really love to work on
          location (<i>looking to relocate!</i>), where I can be truly immersed in programming and be able to learn
          and grow with my teammates - though I'd happily work remotely as well. I'm searching for a place with mentorship,
          where everyone is free to ask questions and can communicate openly when things are stressful. I really want to
          learn & grow as a developer in all the best ways - making things accessible to as many folks as possible,
          building projects that look nice and are easy to read and maintain, and being somewhere that's just plain FUN
          to be. If what I work on can benefit the world, no matter how big or small the impact, it would be the icing on the cake. 
          <br><br>
          I'm not looking to be <i>the</i> best - just continuously better than I am at this moment.

        <h3 class="about-headers">Currently Learning</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <strong>Vue!</strong> I've decided it's finally time to dive in and pick a library to learn, & Vue is the one that keeps drawing my attention. So I'm working through some intro classes on <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vue Mastery</a> & <a href="https://vueschool.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vue School</a> to get some of the basics figured out. Then I have a project I want to build with it - I describe that idea on <a href="https://lindakat-blogs.netlify.com/posts/do-i-own-this-a-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my blog in this post!</a> It's been really fun so far, & I'm excited to keep learning & start working with it on a real project.

          <li>
            <a href="https://beginnerjavascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Beginner JavaScript</a> - Though
            I've been using JavaScript for about 3 years now, I'm always looking for new courses to take that help me
            dig in and keep reinforcing the main ideas and concepts of the language. I like Wes' teaching style, so when
            this went on sale for Christmas I couldn't resist!
