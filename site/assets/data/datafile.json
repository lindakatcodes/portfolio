Each year, there's usually some problems that deal with mapping, sorting, or searching problem sets, and each year's map creates a different picture. The puzzles are always challenging and feel so good to complete! And the community is super helpful and friendly. I haven't been able to complete 2019's yet, but I plan to!",
